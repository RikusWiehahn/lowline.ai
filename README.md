# UnderscoreAi

## ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§

- Our aim is to make a utility-first library for completing all sorts of small useful AI tasks
- By building a big set of tried and tested prompts and pipelines we hope we can save developers lots of time!
- We plan to make it free to use with a small built-in delay with aon optional pay-per-use tier that will help subsidize the free tier. Using these two levers we hope to create a tool that generates as much overall value as possible.

Stay tuned!
